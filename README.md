A website that sells pet food mainly for dogs and cats. The website would have a brief description of the company and display dog and cat food products.

<h2>Design Process</h2>

The website is targeted at pet owners looking to buy pet food and those want to know more about the pet food sold. They can use the website to order pet food for their pets, which the website would be able to achieve by allowing users to select various pet foods in different flavours.

- As a cat owner, I want to buy canned cat food for my cat, so that I can feed him.
- As a person considering getting a dog, I want to see what kinds of dog foods are there, so that I know what food I should get for my dog.
- As a dog owner looking to change up my pet's meals, I want to see what other options are there, so I know what I can buy to feed my dog.
