A website that shows a company that sells pet food mainly for dogs and cats. The website would consist of the navigation bar, an image of the company in its homepage, a brief description of the company, the display of the dog and cat food products and ways for users to contact the company.

<h2>Design Process</h2>

The website is targeted at pet owners looking to know more about the pet food sold. They can use the website to see different kinds of pet food for their pets, which the website would be able to achieve by showcasing various pet foods in different flavours.

- As a cat owner, I want to find canned cat food for my cat, so that I can feed him.
- As a person considering getting a dog, I want to see what kinds of dog foods are there, so that I know what food I should get for my dog.
- As a dog owner looking to change up my pet's meals, I want to see what other options are there, so I know what I can buy to feed my dog.

(Wireframes are included in the Wireframes folder)

<h2>Features</h2>

The website would include a navigation bar with the 'Home', 'About', 'Products' buttons which would lead the user to the respective parts of the webpage. The website would also have a cart and search icon.

By clicking on the products, the user would be taken to a seperate page where they can see the product details from there.

Future features:

- The search icon would allow the user to look for a specific pet food product.
- The cart icon would be used to show selected products, and users can add products into their cart.
